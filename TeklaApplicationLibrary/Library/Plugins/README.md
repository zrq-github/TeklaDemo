This is where you need to drop the plugins the ToolLibrary is depending upon. You may acquire those from the Tekla Structures release binaries.

Plugins that are needed for the ToolLibrary are:
 - Tekla.Structures.dll
 - Tekla.Structures.Datatype.dll
 - Tekla.Structures.Dialog.dll
 - Tekla.Structures.Drawing.dll
 - Tekla.Structures.Model.dll
